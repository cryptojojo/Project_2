This project uses the Java programming language to create a GUI interface 
representation of a Smart Oven application. There will be three main menus
to interact with through the use of button presses: Preheat, Cook, and Settings.
The preheat button will allow the user to set the temperature of their oven. A
message will be returned indicating the oven has reached the set temperature.
The cook button will bring up the cooking menu, where the user will be able to
set the cooking time or edit preset cooking options. The final menu will represent
settings. Here the user will be able to add additional accounts by inputting a name
and oven model. 

This project was completed by Ashley Schuelein, Joseph Miller, and Devin Timaul.
